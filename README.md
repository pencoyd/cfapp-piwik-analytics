# Miniature Hipster:
## A Piwik App for Cloudflare -- cfapp_piwik_analytics

  * [Piwik Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/piwik_analytics) CloudFlare App.

Miniature Hipster is the 'random' name provided by Github. I may change it. But it's kind of interesting.
  * Repository URL  [Piwik Analytics App for Cloudflare](https://github.com/px/cfapp-piwik-analytics.git/)

This CloudFlare App aims to improve upon the available Analytics &amp; Tracking options available to users.
  * Initially this App aims to:
    * Be asynchronous in loading
    * work with your own Piwik Analytics installation, or maybe a hosted solution.
    * Support a single Piwik Site ID
    * Support a single Piwik tracker/receiver
    * provide &lt;noscript&gt; tag for recording visitors without Javascript using a gif pixel.
    * utilize [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com) for serving piwik.js quickly if emabled, or the parameters left unsupplied by the user.

 * TODO
    * Support:
        * multiple versions of piwik, currently only 1.10.1 -- FIXME
        * goals, tracking, 5 per site id, maybe more.
