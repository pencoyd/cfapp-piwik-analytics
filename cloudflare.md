# Codename: Miniature Hipster 
## A Piwik App for Cloudflare

This open source CloudFlare app will embed and include the 'piwik.js' using script elements, into all of your webpages with minimal effort, and will then provide your Piwik tracker with analytics about visitors to [your configured domains](https://www.cloudflare.com/my-websites).

### App Features

#### Speed

  * Use [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/) to serve up 'piwik.js' quickly to your visitors(~40-60ms), or your use your own URL.


#### Link Tracking
