## Codename: Miniature Hipster 
### A Piwik App for Cloudflare

This Piwik Analytics Cloudflare Application will help you add the Piwik tracking code on your website pages. To use this app, you need to have Piwik [installed](http://piwik.org/docs/installation/) already, or use a [Piwik Hosting](http://piwik.org/hosting/) package. Setup [your configured domains](https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-apps).




#### App Features


##### Link Tracking
* Easily enable open source analytics tracking for outlinks from your web properties.




##### Privacy Features
* By default obey a visitor's "[Do-Not-Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track)" option with [supported browsers](https://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/browser/donottrack/default.html).
* Loads piwik.js from your own Piwik installation.


## Installation & Configuration


### Simple Configuration
1. Turn it on. Configure where your **Piwik Installation URL** is. By default it will attempt to use **'/piwik'** as a relative URL. This is used to load the *piwik.js* library, and also for the tracker destination.
2. Configure a **Website ID** for the domain. If not specified, it will default to use **'1'**.
3. Click **UPDATE**, if configured properly all pages should have Piwik Analytics tracking enabled on them.



#### More Details
* Piwik Installation URL
  * *'https://piwik.example.com'*. Do not add a trailing **'/'** character. Ideally should be utilizing [SSL](https://support.cloudflare.com/forums/21317627-SSL-at-CloudFlare) transport for security purposes. Using a schemeless URL **'//host.tld'** is also valid for use of other protocols, such as [SPDY](https://www.cloudflare.com/spdy). But only if your tracker installation supports it. Leaving this empty will use the default relative URL **'/piwik'**
* Piwik Site Id
  * Website Id to be tracked. If not specified, it will default to use **'1'**.


#### Advanced Configuration
Looking for more? Piwik is an incredible application. It contains a very large feature set of well documented API calls. Through use of these [Javascript tracking](http://piwik.org/docs/javascript-tracking/) features, and the **Advanced \_paq** field, you will be able to utilize the complete set of Piwik API calls available for your installation.

1. Enable the **Advanced Features Menu** option.
2. Try out some **Advanced \_paq** features. *Examples:*
  * Return 0 `[ function() { return 0;} ]`
  * Hello World displayed in console log `[ function() { return window.console.log( "Hello World"); } ]`
  * Get VisitorId and display in console log `[ function() { return window.console.log( "getVisitorId=" + this.getVisitorId() ); } ]`
  * Set the Document Title using more advanced methods `["setDocumentTitle",document.domain + ' / ' + document.title]`
  * Implement a HeartBeatTimer `['setHeartBeatTimer',30,60]`
3. Enable __Logging__ if you experience issues with the Javascript tracking codes.
