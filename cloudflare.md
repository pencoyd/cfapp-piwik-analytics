#Miniature Hipster: 
## A Piwik App for Cloudflare -- cfapp_piwik_analytics

This app will embed and include the 'piwik.js' using script elements into all your webpages, and then provide your Piwik tracker with analytics about your visitors.

Features
* Speed
  * Use [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/) to serve up 'piwik.js' quickly to your visitors, or your use your own URL.

* Link Tracking
  * Easily enable open source analytics tracking for outlinks from your web properties.

* Privacy
  * By default obey visitor's browser option "[Do-Not-Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track)" with supported browsers.
  * Enable serving your own 'piwik.js' so you have more control.

You turn it on, configure a 'setSiteId', 'setTrackerUrl' and all pages will have Piwik Analytics tracking enabled on them.
