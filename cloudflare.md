## A Piwik App for Cloudflare

This Piwik Analytics Cloudflare Application will help you add the Piwik tracking code on your website pages. To use this app, you need to have Piwik [installed](http://piwik.org/docs/installation/) already, or use a [Piwik Hosting](http://piwik.org/hosting/) package. Setup [your configured domains](https://www.cloudflare.com/my-websites).


### App Features


#### Link Tracking
  * Easily enable open source analytics tracking for outlinks from your web properties.


#### Privacy Features
  * By default obey a visitor's "[Do-Not-Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track)" option with [supported browsers](https://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/browser/donottrack/default.html).
  * Loads piwik.js from your own Piwik installation.


#### Simple Configuration
1. Turn it ON, configure a 'Website ID' for the domain. Or it will by default use WebsiteId '1'
2. Configure where your Piwik Analytics is installed. By default it will attempt to use '/piwik' as the base URL. This is used to load the piwik.js library and also for the tracker destination.
